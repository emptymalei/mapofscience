So the objective of this markdown file is to list some different "representations" of physics on the same thing.


## Electrodynamics


* Classical Electrodynamics
* Quantum and Gauge
* Extra-dimensions - Kaluza Klein Theory and String Theory
* Hidden Planes - Grassmanian Theory
* Hidden Spatial Geometry


## Thermodynamics

All thermodynamics
